\section{CONCLUSION}
\hspace{0.7cm}To sum up, we have succeeded in making the Login/Logout/Register functions, getting posts and videos from the Internet, and creating a diverse user interface. However, we failed to apply API to all the content in our application, to post status and comments directly from the UI, and to modify the account’s information. In the future, the first thing that we would love to work on is to improve all those flaws, and then maybe we can enhance the interface or add several extra features such as sharing posts, creating stories, posting pictures and videos from the device… 

\vspace{0.7cm}Again, thanks a million to your precious lectures and practical sessions, we could manage to apply so much knowledge into the project to enhance our mobile application.
